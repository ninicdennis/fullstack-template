# Next.js FE Template

This is a work in progress template used by me! This includes my custom linter and prettier configs that I use on other various project. I made this a public template so that anyone can use this!

## Features

-  **Next.js** - Template is based off the latest version of Next.js, with minor optimizations applied!
-  **Typescript** - Written in Typescript to give static typing for added security!
-  **Daisyui** - A component based library based off of tailwindcss!
-  **Tailwindcss** - A very powerful utility-first framework with a very robust class based structure!

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using `yarn install`
2. Start the dev server using `yarn  dev`
